#Bookmark Project

My solution to the Bookmark Landing Page challenge provided on Frontend Mentor which aims to help improve coding skills by building realistic projects.
The goal was to recreate a given design and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I took this chance to use a style pre-processor (Sass) and to further strengthen my front-end skills.

Getting started:

This is a React.js app. To get started run the following commands in the root directory of the project.

npm install
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173/ with your browser to see the result.
